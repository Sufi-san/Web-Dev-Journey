        <!-- All elements have default position as 'position: static' -->
        <!-- The position attribute of elements can be modified to change their behavior 
             Elements with 'position: fixed' do not occupy extra space on the web-page 
             They also have a fixed position and scrolling does not affect their position 
             We can define pixel measurements of top, bottom, left, right for these elements
             which tells the distance between the element and the browser window's edges
             Based on these distances the element can also stretch between the four edges
             Upon changing the size of the browser window, these elements behave like a
             flexbox flexing both vertical and horizontal direction to maintain their
             distance from edges
             In addition to these properties we can also use height or width to resize
             the element.

        <!-- Position: Absolute & Relative -->
        <!-- Position Absolute has all the properties like top, left, right & bottom however,
             unlike position fixed elements which are placed in the browser window, position 
             absolute elements are placed on the page.
             Absolute elements, move when page is scrolled while fixed ones do not.
             Position absolute is used to place elements on precise locations on our page. 
             Generally, elements which are written below in the HTML document appears in front
             of elements written above it. This can be overridden by using property 'z-index'
             'z-index' is by default zero, elements with higher 'z-index' appear in front of 
             elements with lower z-index
             When placed inside another element, the nested element with position absolute is
             actually 'relative' to the out element and not the webpage. However, only outer 
             elements that have position 'fixed' are able to contain elements with position 
             'absolute'.
             To make position 'static' elements have a relative nested element we use the 
             property, position 'relative'. This property is used in the style of the element
             that needs to 'contain' another relative element, while the 'contained' element 
             will still be position 'absolute'-->

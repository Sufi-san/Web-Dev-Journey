What does a Front-end Developer do? 
-> Design the UI/UX of a web application ensuring that it is efficient, user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. (Front-End Web Developer)
   The term can also be used to describe a person who develops interactive GUI for mobile & desktop interfaces.
   
What is Front-end Development?
-> The type of development done by a Front-end Developer (as mentioned above)

Technologies/Tools/Languages used by Front-end Web Developers:
-> 1. HTML (Declare the Structure & Layout)
   2. CSS (Design and format structure,text ,images, layout and other web elements)
   3. JavaScript (A programming language to add functionality to the website)
   4. Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js to simplify the Front-end Dev process)
   
Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript a developer can develop web applications for various run-time environments which include:
-> 1. Web Browser (most common software for working with information on WWW) (e.g: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge)
   2. Headless Browser (web browsers which have no GUI, used for scraping, unit-testing etc.)(web browsers working from command line for automation)
      (e.g: Headless Chromium, Zombie)
   3. Web Views (frames or single tabs, implemented by the native OS to view webpages in different environments) (e.g: Electron, Tauri.js)
   4. Native from WebTech 
      (creating/crafting code, for non-browser applications(android/iOS) using web-browser development)
      (an initiative for using web technologies to create applications for environments without web-engines) 
      (e.g: React Native, Flutter)
   
Goals to keep in mind during Development:
-> 1. Accessibility (make the website using responsive web desing such that it is easily accessible on different devices Laptops, Tablets, Smartphones)
   2. Performance (manipulating HTML, CSS, JavaScript to improve user-interaction and operation speeds)
   3. Speedy Development (make use of techniques to shorten the development duration and provide quick & accurate results)
   
Other Skills to learn:
-> 1. Testing/Debugging
   2. Version Control System (Git/GitHub)
   3. Problem Solving (DSA/Real Projects)
   4. Staying up-to-date (always learn about new technologies that might affect/improve development process in anyway)
   5. Communication (know the requirement accurately by communicating well with the employer/user)
